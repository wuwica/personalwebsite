  \job{Yume Arcade}{November 2023 -- Current}{Founder \& CTO}%
  {Java -- Spring, NextJS, Postgres, Network Architecture}{%
  \item Founded and led all technical development for a physical arcade business, owning software, hardware, firmware, and network infrastructure end-to-end.
  \item Designed custom PCB hardware and ESP32 (Arduino/C++) firmware to power a proprietary arcade credit system, purpose-built for full hardware control and deep integration with in-house software.
  \item Built bespoke backend services to manage credits, user actions, and device communication, ensuring consistent state across machines with zero production downtime.
  \item Designed and deployed an on-prem server architecture enabling fully offline operation, ensuring low-latency payments and uninterrupted arcade operation independent of internet connectivity
  \item Programmed, manufactured, and deployed a self-service customer kiosk integrating NFC chips, multi-card dispensers, and Square payment terminal APIs, halving the clerk headcount required and freeing staff to focus on higher-value customer interactions.
  \item Built a digital queue management system and customer-facing app that improved peak-hour customer flow, driving an estimated 10\% increase in revenue per hour across all customers.

  \job{ShareSFR}{November 2024 -- Current}{Senior Software Developer}%
  {Python, Langchain -- OpenAI, Postgres, AWS}{%
  \item Designed and implemented an AI-driven, batch document ingestion and parsing service as a solo developer, processing ~3,000 unstructured legal and financial documents into normalized database models.
  \item Built multi-step data pipelines using OpenAI models to transform unstructured data into serialized, versioned records through document classification and entity/date extraction.
  \item Implemented confidence scoring and thresholding to flag uncertain AI outputs and support downstream human review workflows.
  \item Optimized the pipeline to run within AWS micro-instance constraints, reducing per-document processing cost by 75\% while maintaining throughput and reliability
  \item Significantly improved human productivity by reducing manual document tagging, increasing document ingestion volume and enabling faster onboarding of new data.
  \item Owned service architecture, data modeling, and operational tradeoffs for a production AI system despite limited infrastructure and model performance constraints.

  \job{Loblaw Digital}{November 2019 -- November 2024}{Software Developer}%
  {Java -- Spring, Elixir -- Phoenix, GCP, PostgreSQL}{%
  \item Designed and developed a real-time stock visibility feature for the cart service, integrating live inventory data with data science predicted stock levels to reduce product substitutions and improve the customer shopping experience
  \item Refactored logging across key service components and overhauled alerting to better reflect real system state, significantly reducing false positive alerts and improving on-call reliability
  \item Introduced CI/CD performance testing to incentivize better code quality and more consistent performance checks.
  \item Reduced P95 API latency by 15\% and improved performance for large carts by 25\% by identifying and refactoring several key functions. 
  \item Designed and built new components for micro services, redesigned aimed to improve performance, code quality and maintainability
